# AbFT-Net-

In this study we conducted abnormal facial thermal image classification.

The TensorFlow framework (Tensorflow) was used as the backend engine for the Keras application programming interface (API) (Keras). 
Models and algorithms were developed using Keras API (version 2.1.6), 
Python (version 3.5.4) (Python), and OpenCV (4.3.0) library (OpenCV).

Network.py is the code of AbFT-Net.
train1_my_model.h5 is the trained model on dataset split 1.
train2_my_model.h5 is the trained model on dataset split 2.
